Hello, I am Yilun Wang(王逸伦). I recently earned my Ph.D. in Economics at North Carolina State University, specializing in applied econometrics, with a particular focus on deep learning and large language models (LLMs) for financial and macroeconomic decision-making.

My research interest lies at the intersection of asset pricing, financial economics and artificial intelligence, aiming to understand how structured market data, unstructured text, and institutional constraints jointly shape asset prices and policy outcomes.

I have ongoing and completed work on multimodal stock movement prediction, deep latent factor models, LLM-based financial statement analysis, and institution-aware multi-agent systems for monetary policy forecasting.

I welcome collaborations and discussions—please feel free to contact me if you are interested in working together.
