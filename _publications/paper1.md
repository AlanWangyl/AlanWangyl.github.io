Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into financial statement analysis (FSA) presents a transformative opportunity to enhance predictive accuracy and decision-making. This study evaluates the effectiveness of LLMs, particularly GPT-4o, in predicting future earnings based on structured financial data and narrative disclosures. We explore the impact of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and Management Discussion and Analysis (MD\&A) integration on LLM performance. Using a dataset from Compustat spanning 1968 to 2021, we compare LLM-based predictions against traditional benchmarks, including logistic regression, feedforward neural networks (FNNs), and analyst forecasts. Our findings reveal that CoT-enhanced LLMs outperform naive models and early analyst predictions, with further gains achieved by incorporating MD\&A insights. However, despite these improvements, LLMs still underperform specialized deep learning models in numerical prediction tasks. Moreover, LLMs exhibit challenges in anticipating macroeconomic shocks, limiting their robustness during economic downturns. Our study highlights the potential of LLMs in FSA while emphasizing the need for hybrid approaches that integrate structured and unstructured data for superior predictive performance.
