Abstract: We proposed a novel probabilistic dynamic factor model for investment strategies in Asian market, which improves handling of complex and noisy market conditions. Our model integrates deep learning's variational recurrent autoencoder with advanced temporal dependency modeling. A key innovation of our model is its prior-posterior learning method, which refines the model using future data to optimize posterior factors. Designed for volatile stock markets, our model effectively estimates variances from latent space distributions and predicts returns. Statistical and empirical experiments on China and Japan stock market data demonstrate the model's superior performance compared to established traditional and machine learning methods.
