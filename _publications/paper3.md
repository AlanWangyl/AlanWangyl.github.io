Abstract: We propose a novel asset pricing model that combines the latent factor model with deep learning, specifically tailored for time series data. Recognizing the temporal dependencies, our model employs a recurrent neural network to define latent factors and a deep neural network to learn nonlinear factor loadings, guided by observed covariates like asset characteristics. Moreover, we propose an efficient solution with Attention Mechanism to long dependency challenge. Our model is tested on a 60-year dataset of US equity returns. It significantly outperforms benchmarks, achieving higher out-of-sample $R^{2}$ values and better Sharpe ratios for both long-short and long-only portfolios. The model's robustness is further confirmed through simulations in low signal-to-noise scenarios, typical in financial markets.
